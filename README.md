👤 About Me

I’m a curious and motivated frontend developer who’s always looking to learn something new. I love understanding the reasoning behind things — not just how to build them, but why they work the way they do.
I enjoy collaborating, sharing ideas, and getting feedback that helps me improve. My goal is to create clean, functional, and user-friendly interfaces while continuing to grow as a developer.
